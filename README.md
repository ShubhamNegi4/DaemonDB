<h1 align="center">DaemonDB: Lightweight Relational Database Engine</h1>

DaemonDB is a lightweight relational database engine built from scratch in Go. It implements core database concepts including B+ tree indexing, SQL parsing, and in-memory storage management, designed for both educational purposes and practical use cases.

## Overview

DaemonDB provides a clean, well-documented implementation of fundamental database components. The project consists of two main modules: a B+ tree implementation for efficient indexing and a SQL parser for query processing.

**Key Features:**
- Complete B+ tree with insert, search, and delete operations
- SQL parser supporting standard DDL and DML statements
- In-memory storage with page-based architecture
- Thread-safe operations with proper concurrency control
- Educational codebase with clear documentation

## Architecture

The database is built with a modular design separating storage, indexing, and query processing:

- **Storage Layer**: Page-based in-memory storage with 4KB pages
- **Index Layer**: B+ tree implementation for efficient key-value operations
- **Query Layer**: SQL lexer and parser for standard database operations

## B+ Tree Implementation

The B+ tree forms the core indexing mechanism, providing O(log n) performance for all operations.

**Tree Structure:**
- Internal nodes contain keys and child pointers for navigation
- Leaf nodes store actual data with linked list structure for range scans
- Automatic node splitting when capacity is exceeded (32 keys per node)
- Binary search optimization for key lookups

**Operations:**
```go
// Initialize tree
pager := NewInMemoryPager()
cache := NewBufferPool(10)
tree := NewBPlusTree(pager, cache, bytes.Compare)

// Insert data
tree.Insertion([]byte("student_001"), []byte("Alice|A"))

// Search data
result, _ := tree.Search([]byte("student_001"))
fmt.Printf("Found: %s\n", string(result))

// Delete data
tree.Delete([]byte("student_001"))
```

**Configuration:**
- Page size: 4KB (aligned with typical disk block sizes)
- Max keys per node: 32
- Buffer pool: 10 pages (40KB total memory)
- Thread-safe with reader-writer locks

## SQL Parser

A complete SQL processing pipeline from lexical analysis to AST generation.

**Supported Statements:**
```sql
-- Table creation with schema definition
CREATE TABLE students {
    name string,
    age int,
    grade string
}

-- Data insertion
INSERT INTO students VALUES ("Alice Johnson", 20, "A")
INSERT INTO students VALUES ("Bob Smith", 19, "B")

-- Data querying
SELECT * FROM students
SELECT name, grade FROM students

-- Data updates
UPDATE students SET grade = "A+" WHERE name = "Alice Johnson"

-- Table management
DROP students
```

**Parser Architecture:**
- Hand-written lexer for efficient tokenization
- Recursive descent parser for syntax analysis
- AST generation for each statement type
- Bytecode emission for execution planning

## Quick Start

**1. B+ Tree Implementation:**
```bash
cd B+Tree-Implementation
go run *.go
```

This runs the student database example, demonstrating:
- Inserting 5 student records
- Searching for specific students
- Displaying database statistics

**2. SQL Parser:**
```bash
cd Query-Parser
go mod tidy
go run .

# Test with sample queries
echo 'select * from mytable' | go run .
echo 'create table students { name string, age int }' | go run .
```
